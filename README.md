# Implemented:
- Flexible Random Forest Regressor (RF support for my custom model)
- Flexible Tree Regressor (my custom model)
- M5 Regressor (or something similar)
- Learning Vector Quantization
- Perceptron
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- PCA
- k-Nearest Neighbours
- NaiveBayes classifier
- KMeans Clustering
- (Non gradient!) BoostedRegression
- RandomForestRegression
- DecisionTreeRegression

# To implement:
- Neural Network
- Support Vector Machine

# To update:
- Fix the algorithm of the random forest. A random set of predictors should be obtained at each split, rather than for each tree.
